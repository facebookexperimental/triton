# Adaptive FlashAttention tutorial

[`amd_fa_adaptive.py`](amd_fa_adaptive.py) implements adaptive and
fixed-reference non-causal FlashAttention for BF16 tensors on gfx950.  Its
module documentation contains the online-softmax equations, numerical
contracts, pipeline structure, and detailed variant guidance.

The general TLX APIs used to express its register ownership and uniform votes
are documented in the repository [root README](../../../README.md#other-operations).

## API

```python
from third_party.tlx.tutorials.amd_fa_adaptive import attention

# General-purpose adaptive reference tracking.
out = attention(q, k, v)

# Fixed reference for comparison; require proven bounds and profile the target.
out = attention(q, k, v, qk_max_abs=1.0)
```

See the tutorial module docstring for the online-softmax equations, numerical
contracts, pipeline structure, and guidance for selecting the adaptive or
fixed-reference specialization.  The current gfx950 LLVM code is fastest with
adaptive reference tracking; the bounded specialization is not a performance
shortcut unless measurements on the exact target prove otherwise.  Run
`python third_party/tlx/tutorials/amd_fa_adaptive_bench.py --help` for the
correctness/performance driver.
