# TLX - Triton Low-level Extensions

## Introduction

TLX (Triton Low-level Language Extensions) is a low-level, warp-aware, hardware-near extension of the Triton DSL. It provides intrinsics and warp-specialized operations for fine-grained GPU control, hardware-oriented primitives for advanced kernel development, and explicit constructs for GPU memory, compute, and asynchronous control flow, designed for power users pushing Triton to the metal.
